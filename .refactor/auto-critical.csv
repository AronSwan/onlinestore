Risk Assessment:
--------------------
[HIGH] Memory Leak Risk: 5 patterns detected
  - setInterval/setTimeout without cleanup
  - addEventListener without removeEventListener
  - Potential resource leaks
[MEDIUM] Authentication System: 15 files found
  - Requires manual review for privilege escalation

Recommendations:
---------------
1. Review all setInterval/setTimeout usage for proper cleanup
2. Implement removeEventListener for all addEventListener calls
3. Conduct manual security review of authentication logic
4. Add automated tests for privilege escalation scenarios
5. Implement proper resource cleanup in component lifecycle
