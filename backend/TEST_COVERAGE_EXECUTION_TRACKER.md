## Weekly Summary

### Week 1 Summary
**Start Coverage**: 0% | **End Coverage**: 21.39% | **Improvement**: 21.39%

#### Major Accomplishments:
- Successfully ran test coverage analysis
- Identified current state of all test modules
- Discovered that core services (Users, Products, Orders) have good coverage (88-91%)
- Found that controller tests exist but have 0% coverage
- Auth service has moderate coverage (53.41%) but needs improvement

#### Challenges Faced:
- Overall coverage is below the 70% threshold
- Many tests are failing (81 out of 202)
- Controller tests are not properly implemented
- Missing test utilities and mock services

#### Lessons Learned:
- Test infrastructure is mostly in place but needs refinement
- Core service tests are well-implemented
- Controller tests need significant work
- Need to focus on fixing failing tests first

#### Next Week Focus:
- Fix failing tests to improve test reliability
- Implement controller tests to increase overall coverage
- Add test utilities and mock services
- Improve Auth service coverage from 53.41% to 90%

## Recommendations for Future Work

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Fix failing tests** - Address the 81 failing tests to improve reliability
2. **Implement controller tests** - All controller files exist but have 0% coverage
3. **Improve Auth service coverage** - Increase from 53.41% to 90% target
4. **Add missing npm scripts** - Add test:coverage, test:watch, test:ci scripts
5. **Create test utilities** - Implement test helpers and mock services

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Implement integration tests** - Add database, Redis, and external service tests
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** - Configure automated testing and coverage reporting
3. **Add E2E testing** - Implement end-to-end test scenarios
4. **Performance testing** - Add load and stress testing
5. **Security testing** - Implement security-focused tests

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Achieve 90%+ overall coverage** - Exceed the 80% target
2. **Implement continuous monitoring** - Set up coverage trend monitoring
3. **Automate test maintenance** - Implement tools to keep tests updated
4. **Establish test-driven development** - Make TDD part of the development process
5. **Create comprehensive test documentation** - Document all testing practices and procedures
